This repository contains the official source code and experimental pipeline for the paper: **"Evaluating Oversampling Methods for Imbalanced Arabic Dialect Identification"**. 

This project investigates Arabic dialect identification using a feature-engineered machine learning approach, focusing specifically on handling **severe class imbalance** through density-based oversampling techniques in a highly sparse 5,644-dimensional text feature space.

## 📈 Evaluated Imbalance Handling Methods
This project explores and rigorously evaluates several data-level and algorithm-level approaches:
* **Original** (Imbalanced data without resampling)
* **SMOTE** (Standard Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
* **ASTRA-SMOTE** (*Adaptive Safe-Threshold Resampling Algorithm* - implemented in files as `knsmote`)
* **SMOTE-RADIANT** (*Robust Auto-Density Inter-class Anomaly Neutralization Technique* - implemented in files as `dbscansmote`)
* **Balanced Weighting** (Cost-sensitive learning via inverse-frequency weights)

**Classifiers Used:** LightGBM (leaf-wise) and XGBoost (level-wise).

## 🏆 Key Findings & Results

Our empirical evaluation in a 5,644-dimensional sparse text space revealed that conventional generative oversampling (SMOTE) and cost-sensitive weighting (Balanced Weighting) often distort decision boundaries, sacrificing majority-class precision for minority-class recall. 

The proposed density-filtered approach, **SMOTE-RADIANT**, paired with a leaf-wise gradient boosting architecture (LightGBM), emerged as the champion configuration:

* **Superior Performance:** Achieved the highest Macro-F1 score (**0.8539**) and overall accuracy (**89.70%**).
* **Safe Minority Rescue:** Successfully improved the recognition of the severely underrepresented Jordanian dialect without substantially degrading the majority Syrian class.
* **Statistical Significance:** 1,000-iteration bootstrapping confirmed that the improvement over the original baseline is highly significant (*p < 0.001*) with a large effect size (Cohen's *r* = 0.511).
* **Noise Reduction:** RADIANT autonomously filtered out ~18% of overlapping synthetic anomalies, preserving inter-class boundary structure.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to run this pipeline:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate virtual environment (Linux/macOS)
source .venv/bin/activate
# Or on Windows:
# .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🌐 Interactive Streamlit Dashboard

A live deployment of the dashboard is available here:

👉 [Live Streamlit Demo](https://arabic-dialect-identification.streamlit.app/)

This repository also includes a Streamlit-based Arabic Dialect Identification dashboard for real-time inference and qualitative analysis.

The dashboard source code is included for reproducibility and demonstration purposes. However, pretrained inference artifacts are excluded from the repository due to storage constraints.

> **Note:** The Streamlit dashboard requires pretrained model artifacts and feature extraction assets that are not included in this repository.

### 📦 Required Inference Artifacts

The interactive dashboard depends on several pretrained assets that are excluded from version control:

- Trained LightGBM and XGBoost model files (`model_*.pkl`)
- Feature extraction pipeline (`shami_feature_extractor.pkl`)
- Label encoder (`label_encoder.pkl`)

These artifacts are omitted due to repository size limitations and deployment constraints.

These artifacts can be reproduced by executing the full experimental pipeline described in the notebook execution order below.

### 🚀 Launch the Dashboard

The interactive dashboard is located in the `app-streamlit/` directory.

```bash
# Move to Streamlit app directory
cd app-streamlit

# Launch dashboard
python -m streamlit run app.py
```

After launching, open the local URL displayed in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:8501`).

### 🧠 Dashboard Features

* **Interactive Inference**
  Predict Levantine Arabic dialects from raw Arabic text input.

* **Batch Processing**
  Perform multi-line batch inference and export predictions as CSV.

* **Pipeline Diagnostics**
  Inspect cleaning, normalization, tokenization, and character-stream transformations.

* **Experiment Configuration**
  Dynamically switch between:
  
  - Original
  - SMOTE
  - ASTRA-SMOTE
  - SMOTE-RADIANT
  - Balanced Weighting

* **Robust Invalid Input Handling**

  Inputs without sufficient Arabic dialectal content are automatically detected and safely rejected as:

  > *Dialect Not Detected*

## 📊 Dataset

This study utilizes the publicly available **Shami Corpus** (Kwaik et al., 2018) for Levantine Arabic dialect classification (Jordanian, Lebanese, Palestinian, Syrian). 

Please download the dataset from the official repository and place it in the designated directory before running the notebooks:
`dataset/`

> **Note:** Due to licensing and size constraints, the dataset is not included in this repository.

- The pipeline is designed with a strict train/validation/test split to prevent data leakage during out-of-fold stacking and resampling.

- Ensure that the notebooks are executed in the exact order listed above to maintain consistency in feature block generation.
